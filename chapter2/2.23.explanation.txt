The subsets function operates on two parts: the first element of the input list, and the rest. 

The first element is identified using (car input). 

'rest' is computed by calling subset on (cdr input). subsets recurses in this way.

The base case of the subsets function occurs when it is called on an empty list. The return value is a list containing an empty list: (())

Once 'rest' is computed at a certain recursion level, the 'first' element is paired with each element of 'rest', and the resulting list is appended to the end of 'rest'.

Sample input: 
       	 (subsets (list 1 2 3))
	 first = 1
	  rest = (subsets (list 2 3))
	      	 first = 2
	      	  rest = (subsets (list 3))
		         first = 3
		          rest = (subsets (list '()))
		       	       = (())  
			 retrn = (() (3))
		 retrn = (() (3) (2) (2 3))
	 retrn = (() (3) (2) (2 3) (1) (1 3) (1 2) (1 2 3))
